I am an Associate Professor *(tenured)* of Political Science at the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University and a SNSF Ambizione Grant Holder at the University of Zurich. 

I primarily work on and teach *Comparative Politics*, *Political Behavior* and *Political Economy*. As a scientist, I seek to address research questions which are relevant to both the academic as well as the public debate. This means that I work on some of the key challenges contemporary democracies are facing such as the rise of extremism, its societal consequences, remedies to mitigate extremism, and the erosion of social norms more generally. My studies are primarily empirically oriented using research designs which seek to rigorously test theoretical arguments mostly with (quasi-)experimental designs. Currently, my major research projects are working on the following research questions:

a) What are the causes for the rise of challenger parties? Does the electoral success of extreme parties affect public opinion? And, how do extreme positions by political elites and the media affect public opinion? (SNSF Ambizione Grant: [Causes & Consequences of Extreme Party Entrance](https://extremeentrance.github.io))

b) What are democratic norms on the citizen-level? Which role does the social environment play for citizens' perception of democratic norms? What are the feedback effects on citizens if political elites break with democratic norms? (Carlsberg Foundation Young Research Fellowship & AUFF Starting Grant: [DEMNORM - Democratic Norms](https://demnorm.github.io/))
