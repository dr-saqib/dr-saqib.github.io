I am an Associate Professor *(tenured)* of Political Science at the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University and a SNF Ambizione Grant Holder at the University of Zurich. 

My major research interest focuses on trying to understand how norms shift in our societies. For instance, in my [SNSF Ambizione Project](https://extremeentrance.github.io) I study how the emergence of radical parties changes people's perception of norms in politics, discourses and behavior. In my research, I seek to address research questions which are relevant to both the academic as well as the public debate. My studies are primarily empirically oriented using research designs which seek to rigorously test theoretical arguments mostly with (quasi-)experimental designs.
