I am an Associate Professor *(tenured)* of Political Science at the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University and a SNSF Ambizione Grant Holder at the University of Zurich. I primarily work on and teach Comparative Politics, Political Behavior and Political Economy. As a scientist, I seek to address research questions which are relevant to both the academic as well as the public debate. This menas that I work on some of the key challenges contemporary democracies are facing such as the rise of extremism, the legitimization of extreme attitudes, and the erosion of social norms more generally. My studies are primarily empirically oriented using research designs which seek to rigorously test theoretical arguments mostly with (quasi-)experimental designs. Currently, my major research interest focuses on trying to understand how social norms shift in our societies:

a) How extreme positions by political elites and the media affect public opinion (SNSF Ambizione Project: [Causes & Consequences of Extreme Party Entrance](https://extremeentrance.github.io))

b) What democratic norms are on the citizen-level and which role elite behavior places for the public's perception of democratic norms (Carlsberg Foundation Young Research Fellowship & AUFF Starting Grant: [DEMNORM - Democratic Norms](https://demnorm.github.io/))
